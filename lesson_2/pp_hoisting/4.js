// Without running the following code, determine what it logs to the console:

var bar = 82;
function foo() {
  var bar = bar - 42;
  console.log(bar)
}

foo(); // NaN

/*
Hoisting treats this code as though we wrote it like this:

function foo() {
  var bar;
  bar = bar - 42;
  console.log(bar)
}

var bar;

foo();

This rewritten code helps us see that bar is undefined when we try to subtract 42 from it. 
That operation reassigns bar to NaN, which is what gets logged to the console.
