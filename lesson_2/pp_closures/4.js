/*
It demonstrates that each returned function has an independent copy of the counter variable. 
They are, in fact, two different variables entirely; they just have the same name. 
When we increment the counter variable from incrementCounter1's envelope, 
it has no effect on the one in incrementCounter2's envelope.
